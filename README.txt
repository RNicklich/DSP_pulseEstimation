Project Instructions:

Step 1:
Use ECGR4124_Project.m to analyze a video file.
--> face.mp4 and DylanVid.mp4 are provided

Step 2:
If face.mp4 was analyzed in Step 1:
--> run Heartbeat_impulse.m
If DylanVid.mp4 was analyzed in Step 1:
--> run Hearbeat_impulse_vid2.m
*This is important, becasue Hearbeat_impulse_vid2.m is taylored to an expected result
*which is an extrenuous case (since the measured heart rate is lower than average)

Step 3: 
Use the resulting graphs to confirm hear rate estimate. 
To obtain heart rate, multiply best fit frequency by 60.
e.g.: 0.97Hz*60s = 58.2bpm
